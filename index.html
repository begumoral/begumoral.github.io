								<p>Hi, there! I'm Begüm, a 21-year-old Turkish girl currently studying in second year of Computer Engineering at Politecnico di Torino. Previously studied Mathematics and Computer Science at Istanbul Kültür University, before transferring to continue my education in Turin, Italy.</p>
								<p>My goal is to become successful in the fields of computer science, especially in data science, and business. I have a passion for entrepreneurship and brainstorming on start-up ideas. Thinking, learning and creating new things make me who I am.</p>
								<P>Outside of academics, being an easy going person, I love meeting with new people, immersing myself in new cultures and actively participating in communities. Being a native Turkish and advanced English speaker, nowadays, I am learning German and Italian. Apart from learning new languages, I have many hobbies. </p>
								<p>Being a STEM girl, keeping up with science and technology fascinate me. I enjoy challenging myself with chess and brain teasers, but I also love traveling and capturing moments through photography. Sometimes I do photo and video editing, it is something I started as a child and still cherish to this day. Recently, I even started my own Instagram blog. Please don't hesitate to <a href="https://www.instagram.com/begumsjourney/">check it out</a>!</p>
								<p>On this part of the website, I thought I'd share a bit about myself. While you can find more details about my experiences, volunteering activities, and other relevant aspects on my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/begumoraal/">LinkedIn profile</a> and resume, I wanted to give you a glimpse into who I am here .</p>
								<p>Life is a journey, and this one's mine. Welcome aboard as I navigate through it all.</p>
